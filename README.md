The JDBC CRUD Operation Project is a Java-based application demonstrating the core functionalities of Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a relational database using JDBC.
Using this project, users can establish database connections, insert new records, retrieve existing data, update records, and delete entries.
I have commented the Database creation and table creationin in the main class(Milk_Product) for the user referance.
I have declared qrNumber in the table as Primary Key .So it will restrict duplicate entry in the DataBase.
In this project I have used mySQL DataBase.
